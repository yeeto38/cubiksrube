## cubiksrube
Rubik's Cube project

Keybinds are pretty self expalanatory, (-) key to show keybinds for practice.

The Alg calculator function is kinda just there for fun, tried to make it off of Jperm's Your Algorithm Sucks (proof) video

To run:
- Make sure you have pyinstaller (python3 -m pip install pyinstaller)
- Go to your terminal and change your directory to the place where the file is (cd)
- run pyinstaller cubiksrube.spec
- you will need these libraries: os, sys, tkinter, pygame, random, math, numpy, csv
- After running pyinstaller, it should make a dist folder which has an exe inside
- Doubleclick the exe and the program will run
