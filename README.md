## cubiksrube
Rubik's Cube project

Keybinds are pretty self expalanatory, (-) key to show keybinds for practice.

The Alg calculator function is kinda just there for fun, tried to make it off of Jperm's Your Algorithm Sucks (proof) video

To run:
- You can just run finalcube.py and it should work just fine
- You can also run it as an exe 
    - In your terminal, cd to the directory you downloaded the folder to (ie. cd Downloads/cubiksrube) 
    - type pip install . (you might have to do something like python3 -m pip install . or python -m pip install .)
    - type pyinstaller cubiksrube.spec
        - This may take a while and there will be a bunch of numbers and letters going on your terminal. This is fine.
    - Go to finder/file explorer and in ./cubiksrube/dist there should be an executable file
    - Double click to run. A terminal will open and you just have to wait a bit for the program to open
